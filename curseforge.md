# First-person Model

Enables the third-person Model in first-person, so you can experience Minecraft from Steve's real perspective. This mod doesn't change any animations, so you also get to see Mojangs "questionable" animation decisions(looking at you, shield + bow). However this mod adds so few and simple mixin hooks into the game, it should work with other mods that come out(MoBends, a real eating/crawling animation, custom 3d armor, etc). Since 1.3.0 this mod also adds the option to display a Bedrock/PocketEdition like Paper Doll.

Since this mod is purely visual, it will also work on vanilla servers.

Requires ModMenu(used to change settings).
