# First-person Model

Enables the third-person Model in first-person, so you can experience Minecraft from Steve's real perspective. This mod doesn't change any animations, so you also get to see Mojangs "questionable" animation decisions(looking at you, shield + bow). However this mod adds so few and simple mixin hooks into the game, it should work with other mods that come out(MoBends, a real eating/crawling animation, custom 3d armor, etc).

Since this mod is purely visual, it will also work on vanilla servers.

Requires ModMenu(used to change settings).

### Dependencies

- [Not Enough Animations (Forge&Fabric)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/not-enough-animations)
- [Fabric API (Fabric)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
- [ModMenu (Fabric)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)

### Incompatible

- Epic Fight mod
- Optifine emissive textures
- Sitting on modded chairs/mounts doesn't look right
- Any mods replacing the player model might not work correctly

### Help, where did feature X go?

Since this mod became too large, I started cutting it into smaller, more manageable parts. All the smaller mods are available for Fabric and Forge + back-ported to some older versions!

- [3d Skin Layers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/skin-layers-3d) Turns the skin layers from a flat box into a 3d model.
- [PaperDoll](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/paperdoll) adds a highly configurable Bedrock/PocketEdition like player preview.
- [Not Enough Animations](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/not-enough-animations) brings first-person animations to the third-person, like eating, drinking and holding maps.
- [Wavey Capes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waveycapes) turns the slab of a cape into something more dynamic and pleasant to look at.
